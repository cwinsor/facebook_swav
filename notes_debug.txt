Debug notes...

Note 1:
When running eval_linear.py: val_dataset = datasets.ImageFolder(os.path.join(args.data_path, "val"))
* Signature: Couldn't find any class folder in C:\Users\chris\Downloads\ILSVRC\Data\CLS-LOC\val.
* Problem: the ILSVRC val data does not have the "synset" folder structure required by ImageFolder.
* Discussion: 
  * https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/issues-with-dataloader-for-imagenet-should-i-use-datasets-imagefolder-or-datasets-imagenet/115742/7
and
  * https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/main/imagenet
* Solution:
  * https://github.com/soumith/imagenetloader.torch
  * in other words - 
    * clone the git from soumith and grab the valprep.sh file
    * copy to ...\ILSVRC\Data\CLS-LOC\val
    * run it
    * repeat for ...\ILSVRC\Annotations\CLS-LOC\val
  * This moves the val images (or annotatios) into folders which will satisfy pytorch ImageFolder. NOTE there is some risk here relying on soumith - really there should be a script to verify/reproduce soumith's script - this would involve: read each annotations/val/*.xml, confirm there is only a single "semset", create semset folder (if not created) and move file to that folder.  Need to do this for data/val and annotations/val.
